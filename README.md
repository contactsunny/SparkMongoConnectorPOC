# SparkMongoConnectorPOC

This is a simple Spring Boot command line runner project, which creates a Spark Context, connects to a MongoDB database, and loads the data into a SparkJavaContext. From there, it's the regular JavaRDD stuff.

## The Mongo Spark Connector Dependency

The ```mongo-spark-connector``` dependency is available in the central maven repository. You can find the source code and the usage [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/spark-connector/master/).
